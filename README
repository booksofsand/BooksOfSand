Books of Sand

A project inspired by and based on SARndbox. See Books of Sand Documentation for more information. 

Project goals:
- Want users to be able to interact with words through the medium of sand
- Use SARndbox open source program as foundation
  - A program written by a UC Davis professor that projects topographical color maps onto sand and updates in real time as sand is moved around
  - Instead of different colors at different depths, we want to use text of different pages at different depths
- Height / depth of sand determines what text is displayed
  - Making a gap is like tearing a hole through to another page
- Input text files for display
- Screenshot capabilities
